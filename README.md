# PySimpleGUI-MVC-Prototype
This code demonstrates using PySimpleGUI and the peewee ORM to develop an MVC reservations demo system.  The reservations view or GUI is implemented in three Python classes that use PySimpleGUI to display forms and tables for entering, displaying, and editing 
reservations data.  The reservations model is implemented with the Python peewee ORM connected to a Sqlite database.  The
reservations controller connects the view and model, and it updates the view whenever the user retrieves reservations or deletes 
or edits a reservation.  

A detailed description of this code is provided in the Wiki pages above.
